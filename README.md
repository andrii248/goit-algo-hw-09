### Coin Change Algorithm Comparison

#### Time & Space Complexity

| Algorithm               | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| **Greedy**              | O(N)            | O(1)             |
| **Dynamic Programming** | O(N\*M)         | O(N)             |

#### Key Differences

- **Greedy** is faster (O(N)) but may not always give the best solution.
- **Dynamic Programming** ensures the optimal solution but is slower (O(N\*M)).
- **Greedy is better** for large amounts with standard coins.
- **Dynamic Programming** for arbitrary coin sets.

### Conclusion

**Greedy** is better when speed is required, **Dynamic Programming** can be used when more precise result required.
